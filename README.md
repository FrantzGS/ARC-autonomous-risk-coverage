# ARClimate
Decentralized parametric weather insurance protocol. Built for ETHGlobal Unite Hackathon 2025.
Overview
ARC (Autonomous Risk Coverage) is a decentralized parametric insurance protocol designed to support farms and agricultural actors affected by extreme weather events.

Vision  
Make climate risk protection accessible, transparent, and automated using smart contracts and decentralized data oracles like Chainlink.  
Inspired by the recent Mastercard × Chainlink collaboration, ARC also explores integrating fiat on-ramps, allowing farmers to activate their insurance coverage directly via card payment, while handling on-chain logic and payouts through stablecoins.

### Installation
