# ARClimate
Decentralized parametric weather insurance protocol. Built for ETHGlobal Unite Hackathon 2025.
Overview
ARC (Autonomous Risk Coverage) is a decentralized parametric insurance protocol designed to support farms and agricultural actors affected by extreme weather events.

## Vision

ARClimate aims to become the leading decentralized parametric insurance platform for agriculture, leveraging smart contracts combined with reliable weather data and decentralized oracles.

The initial goal (MVP) is to provide simple, automated climate risk coverage with premium payments made via cryptocurrencies using Metamask.

For version 2, we plan to integrate fiat payments through credit cards (e.g., MasterCard) and SEPA bank transfers, using secure fiat-to-crypto conversion solutions to make insurance accessible to a broader audience.

---

This progressive approach ensures a robust and user-friendly service from the first release, while paving the way for mass adoption through traditional payment methods.


### Installation

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install

npx hardhat compile

```


## Swap Integration

ARClimate integrates 1inch via the frontend using Metamask to perform ETH, USDC, or USDT swaps before insurance subscription. This ensures simplicity, security, and user-controlled transactions while enabling premium payments in stablecoins for payouts.
